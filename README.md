# Laravel Accept-Language to SetLocale (ALSL)

Adds support for iln8 Detection.

Iteration of a user's language preferences set in the `Accept-Language` request header, using order of language preference from users web browser; attempts to find a matching locale available in Laravel `resources/lang` directory.

- Attempts Fallback to a mainland language, honouring the users first preferences.
- Restores saved user preference from an authenticated user  `User::locale` if set.
- Fallback to Laravel configuration `app.locale` else `en` (English).

## Installation

`composer require marcnewton/laravel-alsl`

## Usage Information

`app()->getLocale()` will return the value of either the users web browser language preference or authenticated user `locale` attribute if present, as long as a matching ISO is found in the `resources/lang` directory else the `app.locale` config value will be used.

## Language Variants

To support variants, create language translation folders in `resources/lang`.

For example, to support **English (United States)** and **English (United Kingdom)**; create the following directories: `en-US` and `en-GB` in addition to `en` (English).

## How detection works.

Web browsers are natively set to their systems user preferences for languages on installation and then further fallback preferences can be configured in the browser by the user, this information is sent with requests via a header called [Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language), it is a widely supported standard often overlooked.

The header is processed and a best match for laravels language directories is detected and set using Laravels built in locale functionality.

Here is an example of some different senarios for an individual whos preference is Mexican Spanish (espa√±ol mexicano es-MX) and their secondary fallback is United States Spanish (Estados Unidos es-US):

| Available Server Languages | Matches |
| - |- |
| **en, es_US, es** | `es-US` |
| **en, es_US, es_MX, es** | `es-MX` |
| **en, es** | `es` |
| **en** | `en` |
| **en, en_US, es_US, es_MX, es_CL** | `es-MX` |

If the user only specified **Spanish** then this would match `es` but if the server only has `en` then it would present `en`.

However, if the user specified a preference for **Spanish** first then a Spanish variant, `es` would match first rather than the latter choices for variants unless the server does not have an `es` language folder, a variant folder will match else fallback to a configuration default.

**Underscores** from the `Accept-Language` header are converted to **Hyphens** to align with usages in PHP & Javascript localization methods.

## Deployments
When adding or removing language support in `resources/lang`, you should ensure you run `php artisan cache:forget resources.languages` to clear the cache.
